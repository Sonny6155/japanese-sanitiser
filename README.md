# japanese-sanitiser

Script for detecting issues in Japanese text. Initially designed to help lyric
transcription, building from santisation code of a previous project.

Has limited transposition abilities

TODO:
- Function to transpose "„ÄÅ", common quote brackets to kana (don't bother with reverse)
- Proper file/line trimming
- Non-warning (formatting) detection of JP punctuation after EN and vice versa
- Detection of untrimmed lines
